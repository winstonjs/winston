## v3.4.0 / 2022-01-10

Yesterday's release was done with a higher sense of urgency than usual
due to vandalism in the `colors` package.
This release:

 - ties up a loose end by including [#1973] to go with [#1824]
 - adds a missing http property in NpmConfigSetColors [#2004] (thanks @SimDaSong)
 - fixes a minor issue in the build/release process [#2014]
 - pins the version of the testing framework to avoid an issue with a test incorrectly failing [#2017]

The biggest change in this release, motivating the feature-level update, is
[#2006] Make winston more ESM friendly, thanks to @miguelcobain.

Thanks also to @DABH, @wbt, and @fearphage for contributions and reviews!

## v3.2.1 / 2019-01-29
### UNBOUND PROTOTYPE AD INFINITUM EDITION

- #[1579], (@indexzero)  Fallback to the "root" instance **always** created by
  `createLogger` for level convenience methods (e.g. `.info()`, `.silly()`).
  (Fixes [#1577]).
- [#1539], (@indexzero) Assume message is the empty string when level-helper
  methods are invoked with no arguments (Fixed [#1501]).
- [#1583], (@kibertoad) Add typings for defaultMeta (Fixes [#1582])
- [#1586], (@kibertoad) Update dependencies.

## v3.2.0 / 2019-01-26
### SORRY IT TOO SO LONG EDITION

> **NOTE:** this was our first release using Github Projects. See the
> [3.2.0 Release Project](https://github.com/orgs/winstonjs/projects/3).

### New Features!

- [#1471], (@kibertoad) Implement child loggers.
- [#1462], (@drazisil) Add handleRejection support.
  - [#1555], (@DABH) Add fixes from [#1355] to unhandled rejection handler.
- [#1418], (@mfrisbey) Precompile ES6 syntax before publishing to npm.
  - [#1533], (@kibertoad) Update to Babel 7.
- [#1562], (@indexzero) [fix] Better handling of `new Error(string)`
  throughout the pipeline(s). (Fixes [#1338], [#1486]). 

### Bug Fixes

- [#1355], (@DABH) Fix issues with ExceptionHandler (Fixes [#1289]).
- [#1463], (@SerayaEryn) Bubble transport `warn` events up to logger in
  addition to `error`s.
- [#1480], [#1503], (@SerayaEryn) File tailrolling fix.
- [#1483], (@soldair) Assign log levels to un-bound functions.
- [#1513], (@TilaTheHun0) Set maxListeners for Console transport.
- [#1521], (@jamesbechet) Fix Transform from `readable-stream` using CRA.
- [#1434], (@Kouzukii) Fixes logger.query function (regression from `3.0.0`)
- [#1526], (@pixtron) Log file without .gz for tailable (Fixes [#1525]).
- [#1559], (@eubnara) Fix typo related to `exitOnError`. 
- [#1556], (@adoyle-h) Support to create log directory if it doesn't exist
  for FileTransport.

#### New `splat` behavior

- [#1552], (@indexzero) Consistent handling of meta with (and without) 
  interpolation in `winston` and `logform`. 
- [#1499], (@DABH) Provide all of `SPLAT` to formats (Fixes [#1485]).
- [#1485], (@mpabst) Fixing off-by-one when using both meta and splat.

Previously `splat` would have added a `meta` property for any additional
`info[SPLAT]` beyond the expected number of tokens.

**As of `logform@2.0.0`,** `format.splat` assumes additional splat paramters
(aka "metas") are objects and merges enumerable properties into the `info`.
e.g. **BE ADVISED** previous "metas" that _were not objects_ will very likely
lead to odd behavior. e.g.

``` js
const { createLogger, format, transports } = require('winston');
const { splat } = format;
const { MESSAGE, LEVEL, SPLAT } = require('triple-beam');

const logger = createLogger({
  format: format.combine(
    format.splat(),
    format.json()
  ),
  transports: [new transports.Console()]
});

// Expects two tokens, but four splat parameters provided.
logger.info(
  'Let us %s for %j',   // message
  'objects',           // used for %s
  { label: 'sure' },   // used for %j
  'lol', ['ok', 'why'] // Multiple additional meta values 
);

// winston < 3.2.0 && logform@1.x behavior:
// Added "meta" property.
//
// { level: 'info',
//   message: 'Let us objects for {"label":"sure"}',
//   meta: ['lol', ['ok', 'why']],
//   [Symbol(level)]: 'info',
//   [Symbol(message)]: 'Let us %s for %j',
//   [Symbol(splat)]: [ 'objects', { label: 'sure' } ] }

// winston >= 3.2.0 && logform@2.x behavior: Enumerable properties
// assigned into `info`. Since **strings and Arrays only have NUMERIC
// enumerable properties we get this behavior!**
//
// { '0': 'ok',
//   '1': 'why',
//   '2': 'l',
//   level: 'info',
//   message: 'Let us objects for {"label":"sure"}',
//   [Symbol(level)]: 'info',
//   [Symbol(message)]: 'Let us %s for %j',
//   [Symbol(splat)]: [ 'objects', { label: 'sure' } ] }
```

## v3.0.0-rc1 / 2017-10-19
### OMG THEY FORGOT TO NAME IT EDITION

 - Fix file transport improper binding of `_onDrain` and `_onError` [#1104](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/pull/1104)

## v3.0.0-rc0 / 2017-10-02
### IT'S-DONE.GIF EDITION

**See [UPGRADE-3.0.md](UPGRADE-3.0.md) for a complete & living upgrade guide.**

**See [3.0.0.md](3.0.0.md) for a list of remaining RC tasks.**

- **Rewrite of core logging internals:** `Logger` & `Transport` are now implemented using Node.js `objectMode` streams.
- **Your transports _should_ not break:** Special attention has been given to ensure backwards compatibility with existing transports. You will likely see this:
```
YourTransport is a legacy winston transport. Consider upgrading to winston@3:
- Upgrade docs: https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/tree/master/UPGRADE.md
```
- **`filters`, `rewriters`, and `common.log` are now _formats_:** `winston.format` offers a simple mechanism for user-land formatting & style features. The organic & frankly messy growth of `common.log` is of the past; these feature requests can be implemented entirely outside of `winston` itself.
``` js
const { createLogger, format, transports } = require('winston');
const { combine, timestamp, label, printf } = format;

const myFormat = printf(info => {
  return `${info.timestamp} [${info.label}] ${info.level}: ${info.message}`;
});

const logger = createLogger({
  combine(
    label({ label: 'right meow!' }),
    timestamp(),
    myFormat
  ),
  transports: [new transports.Console()]
});
```
- **Increased modularity:** several subsystems are now stand-alone packages:
  - [logform] exposed as `winston.format`
  - [winston-transport] exposed as `winston.Transport`
  - [abstract-winston-transport] used for reusable unit test suites for transport authors.
- **`2.x` branch will get little to no maintenance:** no feature requests will be accepted – only a limited number of open PRs will be merged. Hoping the [significant performance benefits][perf-bench] incentivizes folks to upgrade quickly. Don't agree? Say something!
- **No guaranteed support for `node@4` or below:** all code will be migrated to ES6 over time. This release was started when ES5 was still a hard requirement due to the current LTS needs.
